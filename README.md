Introduction:
Women Safety has l ong been a cause of concern so far as humanity i s concerned. It i s,
however, only after the i ntroduction of social media, that the i ssue of women safety (or i t’s l ack
thereof) have been catapulted i nto mainstream attention. Although the use of social media
continues to give women, or any section of society for that matter, a voice to raise their i ssues
and concern, i t seems to have a downside as well. Even after the rising awareness among the
new generation and the strict l egal protocols, i t i s very unfortunate that the number of such
abominable crimes continue to be on the rise.
This i s only the tip of the i ceberg though. Surely Social media provides us with a platform to
share our concerns and feelings, i t i s common to encounter criticism more often than not.
People are quick to j udge, make comments, or demean the person sharing their stories. This
isn’t the only i ssue though. A huge portion of these stories never see the l ight of day because
victims aren’t willing to report these crimes due reasons ranging from fear to societal judgement.
It i s i n these cases, a victim suffers the most and their mental health i s affected.
It goes without saying, that crimes such as domestic violence and sexual harassment need to
be stopped but i t i s equally i mportant that the victims can find a way to share their stories and
get j ustice about i t. It i s necessary to know how and who to approach to seek help and most of
all i t i s necessary that we unite and fight towards such societal evils.

Proposal:
To design a website/portal aimed at helping victims of assault and harassment, Our proposed
website would i ncorporate following functionalities,

● More often than not, a victim of sexual or domestic assault fails to report a crime due to
family pressure, fear of societal j udgement or fear of the perpetrator himself. Sometimes
a victim may want to share his/her feelings but find themselves with no one to share or
complain. Our website aims to host a feed wherein anyone can share their unfortunate
experiences. The person posting will be kept anonymous if they choose to. The i dentity
will only be revealed i n case the person posting i s on the l ookout for professional help. In
any case, no one other than a certified professional would have any i dea about the
person posting.
● The feed is intended to be minimalistic so as to discourage other users from demeaning
another person, however anonymous the person may be.
● The site would enlist certain certified professionals such as lawyers, Women Safety
centric NGOs, Counselors and therapists. A user can enlist the services of these
professions i f they should choose to do so. The purpose of enlisting the services of
these professionals i s to help out victims who do not know the how or the who and those
who are hesitant to ask for help directly. Only after proper verification would be a
professional able to gain access to the restricted posts.
