Project Report - Hack 36 4.0
SafeHouse (Tentative) under Women’s safety

Introduction:
Women Safety has l ong been a cause of concern so far as humanity i s concerned. It i s,
however, only after the i ntroduction of social media, that the i ssue of women safety (or i t’s l ack
thereof) have been catapulted i nto mainstream attention. Although the use of social media
continues to give women, or any section of society for that matter, a voice to raise their i ssues
and concern, i t seems to have a downside as well. Even after the rising awareness among the
new generation and the strict l egal protocols, i t i s very unfortunate that the number of such
abominable crimes continue to be on the rise.
This i s only the tip of the i ceberg though. Surely Social media provides us with a platform to
share our concerns and feelings, i t i s common to encounter criticism more often than not.
People are quick to j udge, make comments, or demean the person sharing their stories. This
isn’t the only i ssue though. A huge portion of these stories never see the l ight of day because
victims aren’t willing to report these crimes due reasons ranging from fear to societal j udgement.
It i s i n these cases, a victim suffers the most and their mental health i s affected.
It goes without saying, that crimes such as domestic violence and sexual harassment need to
be stopped but i t i s equally i mportant that the victims can find a way to share their stories and
get j ustice about i t. It i s necessary to know how and who to approach to seek help and most of
all i t i s necessary that we unite and fight towards such societal evils.

Proposal:
To design a website/portal aimed at helping victims of assault and harassment, Our proposed
website would i ncorporate following functionalities,
● Emergency Protocol: A woman i n distress would be able to send one tap emergency
signals which would share her current l ocation with l ocal l aw enforcement and other
users such that the fastest response can be achieved. We are hoping to build upon the
human capital to help women i n distress.
● More often than not, a victim of sexual or domestic assault fails to report a crime due to
family pressure, fear of societal j udgement or fear of the perpetrator himself. Sometimes
a victim may want to share his/her feelings but find themselves with no one to share or
complain. Our website aims to host a feed wherein anyone can share their unfortunate
experiences. The person posting will be kept anonymous i f they choose to. The i dentity
will only be revealed i n case the person posting i s on the l ookout for professional help. In
any case, no one other than a certified professional would have any i dea about the
person posting.
● The feed is intended to be minimalistic so as to discourage other users from demeaning
another person, however anonymous the person may be.
● The site would enlist certain certified professionals such as lawyers, Women Safety
centric NGOs, Counselors and therapists. A user can enlist the services of these
professions i f they should choose to do so. The purpose of enlisting the services of
these professionals i s to help out victims who do not know the how or the who and those
who are hesitant to ask for help directly. Only after proper verification would be a
professional able to gain access to the restricted posts.
● A rating system would also be i ntroduced so as to help the users choose the best help
they deserve. The rating would be given by users who have enlisted the help of these
professionals. There would be no other way to gain/lose ratings.
